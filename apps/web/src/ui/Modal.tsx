 * of hand-rolled focus-trap/Escape/portal logic: real focus management,
 * scroll locking, and a portal (so a dialog opened from deep in the tree
 * never gets clipped by an ancestor's overflow:hidden) come for free and
 * are battle-tested, instead of this app maintaining its own version of the
 * same ~40 lines forever. Visual styling is untouched — Radix is headless,
 * so .modal-backdrop/.modal keep doing exactly what they did before.
