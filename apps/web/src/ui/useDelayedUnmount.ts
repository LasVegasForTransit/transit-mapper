/**
 * Keeps a piece of UI mounted for `exitMs` after `active` goes false, so a
 * CSS exit animation has time to actually play instead of the content just
 * vanishing the instant React unmounts it. Mirrors what Radix's own Presence
 * does internally for Popover/Dialog content — this is the same idea for
 * plain conditionally-rendered panels (Inspector, the Hide-UI toggle) that
 * aren't wrapped in a Radix primitive.
 *
 * `closing` flips true as soon as `active` goes false, for the render to key
 * a CSS class/data-attribute off of; `mounted` stays true until `exitMs`
 * later, when the caller should actually stop rendering.
