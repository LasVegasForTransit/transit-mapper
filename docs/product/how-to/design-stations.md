# Design stations

A station means different things in different views. In the Network view it's a stop: a point on a
line. In the Infrastructure view it's a place: land with a boundary, and structures on that land.
Both are the same station record.

## Draw station land (Infrastructure view)

With the **Station** tool (`S`):

- **Drag** a rectangle where the station goes, or
- **click** corner points one at a time and finish with `Enter` or double-click (`Esc` cancels).

The boundary you draw _is_ the station, its primary identity in the physical world. The station
anchors itself to the nearest way inside or near the boundary, so its Network-view stop lands on the
line it serves. Reshape the land later by selecting the station and dragging its corner handles.

There is no click-to-place-a-point in this view: the Infrastructure view is 2D, and everything drawn
there has physical extent.

## Add structures on the land

The **Facility** tool's (`F`) menu is organized by what the thing physically is:

- **Access points (placed):** entrance, elevator, bike dock. These are points in the real world too;
  click to place.
- **Structures (drawn to shape):** building, bus bay, platform, parking, depot. Drag to draw their
  footprint.
- **Site boundary:** draw the outline of a standalone facility complex (a transit center that isn't
  a rail station, say).

Anything you draw inside a station's land joins that station automatically: a building becomes the
station's building, a bus bay its bus bay. The inspector's **Complex** tab lists everything the
station owns.

Platforms can also be added from the station inspector's **Physical** tab, which places them along
the anchored way.

## Stops in the Network view

In the Network view the Station tool places schematic stops: click on or near a line and the stop
snaps to it. Stops placed here have no land until you switch to the Infrastructure view and draw
some; the two representations stay linked through the one station record.

## Station complexes

Draw a **Site boundary** (Facility tool) around several related things (a terminal building, bus
bays, an adjacent station) and they group into one complex with its own name and color. Use this for
transfer centers and intermodal terminals where several stations and structures form one real place.
