# Keyboard shortcuts

Press `?` in the editor for this list in a dialog. Everything the keyboard
does is also reachable by mouse. Shortcuts don't fire while you're typing
in a text field.

The single source of truth is `KEY_BINDINGS` in
[`src/editor/keymap.ts`](../../../apps/web/src/editor/keymap.ts); this page mirrors it.

## Editing

| Key                                          | Action                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Esc`                                        | Back out one level: cancel the in-progress draw or armed flow, then drop the tool, then clear the selection |
| `Enter`                                      | Commit the line or road being drawn                                                                         |
| `Delete` / `Backspace`                       | Delete the selection                                                                                        |
| `Ctrl`/`⌘` + `Z`                             | Undo                                                                                                        |
| `Ctrl`/`⌘` + `Shift` + `Z`, `Ctrl`/`⌘` + `Y` | Redo                                                                                                        |

Undo/redo are the only browser-style modifier combos the app claims; all
other `Ctrl`/`⌘` shortcuts pass through to the browser.

## Lanes

These act on the way being drawn right now, or else the selected way,
whichever the cross-section editor is showing.

| Key       | Action                                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `[` / `]` | Remove / add a lane                                                                        |
| `D`       | Flip direction (reverse the whole cross-section)                                           |
| `O`       | Toggle one-way ⇄ two-way; with only the drawing tool armed, arms one-way for the next draw |
| `1`–`9`   | Apply that numbered cross-section preset (or arm it as the drawing default)                |
