# The three views

TransitMapper's core idea is that one system needs more than one representation. The same document
renders three ways:

- **Network** — the schematic. Colored service lines, point stops, one-way chevrons. This is the
  transit map as riders think of it, and the view where you draw and route _services_.
- **Infrastructure** — the physical world. Roads with lanes, tracks, junction footprints, station
  land, buildings. This is where you draw and edit _infrastructure_.
- **Diagram** — a read-only straightened diagram of the network, in the tradition of printed transit
  maps.

The unifying principle: **a unified model that can represent complex physical infrastructure as a
simple network**. In one document a divided six-lane boulevard is simultaneously "the red line goes
down Decatur" and two one-way carriageways with specific lanes, medians, and signalized junctions.
Neither view is a simplification of the other; they're projections of the same data, and details
like one-way direction surface in both (chevrons in Network, lane arrows in Infrastructure).

## Why the Infrastructure view is 2D

This rule does real work: **everything drawn in the Infrastructure view has physical extent.** Ways
have cross-sections with real widths. Stations are land; the boundary you draw defines the station's
identity in this view. Buildings and bus bays are shapes on that land.

The rule exists because point placement in a physical view lies. A station dot on an infrastructure
map defers every real question: where the platforms are, how big the site is, what it displaces.
Those questions are the point of an infrastructure view. Abstraction to a point is the Network
view's job. So the Station tool draws land in Infrastructure and places stops in Network, and
genuinely point-like things (an entrance, an elevator) are the only facilities placed as points.

## Why drawing infrastructure never creates a service

Roads exist independently of buses. When drawing a road also spawned a service, the model claimed
every street was a transit line, and the UI had to ask about frequencies while you were laying
asphalt. So the views' responsibilities are strict: Infrastructure produces ways, Network produces
services over ways. The bridge between them is explicit and two-directional: you can route a service
over existing infrastructure, or adopt real infrastructure under a sketched line. Neither happens as
an implicit side effect of drawing.

## You can sketch first or build the streets first

Some people start with a fantasy network map and only later care about streets; some start by
importing a real city and running service over it. The two bridges exist so neither workflow is a
dead end: a freehand sketch can adopt real streets later, and real streets can carry a routed
service from the first click.
