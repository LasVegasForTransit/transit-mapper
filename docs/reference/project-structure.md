# Project structure

TransitMapper is a pnpm workspace: a Vite + React + TypeScript single-page
app, an optional Cloudflare Worker backend for sharing, and a shared
domain-model package both depend on. The layering rule that organizes
everything: **model → store → rendering/UI**, with purity increasing toward
the model.

```
packages/
  core/          The shared domain model — no DOM, no store, no React.
    src/
      model/     Pure domain: types, catalogs, geometry math, routing.
      geometry/  Pure derived geometry: lane offsets, junction footprints.
      share/     contract.ts — the wire shapes both the app and worker use.
apps/
  web/           The Vite React SPA.
    src/
      editor/    The zustand store (all mutation) and the keyboard system.
      map/       MapLibre integration: layers, pointer interactions, canvas.
      ui/        React components. Thin: read the store, call actions.
      style/     How catalog kinds LOOK (colors, widths, dashes, icons).
      share/     Export (PNG/SVG/JSON) and the share-API client.
      storage/   Local persistence.
    scripts/     verify.ts — the test suite.
  worker/        Cloudflare Worker + D1 migrations for shared snapshots.
docs/            This documentation.
```

`@transitmapper/core` is consumed straight from source (no build step) via
subpath imports, e.g. `@transitmapper/core/model/catalog`. Both `apps/web`
and `apps/worker` depend on it as a workspace package.

## packages/core/src/model/ — the domain

- `system.ts` — every record in a saved document ([Data model](data-model.md)).
- `catalog.ts` — every kind ([Catalogs](catalogs.md)).
- `profile.ts` — pure cross-section operations: build/flip/one-way/derive
  capacity, separate/combine carriageway profiles.
- `geo.ts` — geographic math: projections, distances, polyline offsetting,
  point-in-polygon.
- `routeGraph.ts` — the routing graph over ways and junctions;
  `routeBetween` finds paths for service drawing and adoption.
- `validate.ts` — system-level checks (crossings, dangling refs) surfaced in
  the Issues popover.
- `serialize.ts` — versioned save/load with migrations (v3 → current).
- `import.ts` — OpenStreetMap import: pure tag classification plus the one
  Overpass fetch.
- `diagramLayout.ts` — the Diagram view's schematic layout.
- `cost.ts` — rough cost estimation.
- `ids.ts` — id generation.

## packages/core/src/geometry/ — derived street geometry

- `streets.ts` — per-lane polylines, divider lines, and direction arrows
  derived from a way's profile; trimming at junctions.
- `junctions.ts` — junction footprints (arm trim-back, corner geometry),
  default lane connectors, connector curves.

Both are pure and memoized; nothing here is stored. See
[Geometry and routing](../explanation/geometry-and-routing.md).

## packages/core/src/render/ — drawing a system without a map

- `buildFeatures.ts` — the system-to-styled-GeoJSON projector. Shared by the
  editor map, the embed, image exports and server-side previews, so none of
  them can drift from the others.
- `project.ts` — Web Mercator projection and `fitBounds`, matching MapLibre's
  conventions but needing no map. What the Worker projects through.
- `svg.ts` — the vector composition (geometry plus title, legend, north arrow,
  scale bar). Takes a `project` callback, so the browser can pass MapLibre's
  and the Worker its own.
- `preview.ts` — the share-card preset over `svg.ts`, plus the card size and
  the renderer version that participates in edge-cache keys.
- `legend.ts`, `scaleBar.ts`, `constants.ts`, `iconName.ts` — supporting
  pieces, all DOM-free.

## packages/core/src/style/ — how things are drawn

- `catalogStyle.ts` — the only place catalog entries' visual properties
  (color, width, dashed) live; `model/catalog.ts` stays pure domain data.
- `lvbtBrand.ts` — the org's brand tokens and typeface, transcribed from
  lasvegasfortransit.org/brand for anything rendered for the outside world.

See [Sharing surfaces](../explanation/sharing-surfaces.md).

## apps/web/src/embed/ — the embeddable map

- `main.ts` — a second Vite entry (`embed.html`, served at `/e/:id`) that
  mounts MapLibre and the feature builder and nothing else: no React, no
  editor store. Kept deliberately small because it loads inside someone
  else's page.

## apps/worker/src/ — the Worker

- `index.ts` — share create/fetch, the GTFS proxy, per-share preview images,
  oEmbed, the embed and share-page routes with their framing headers, and the
  nightly expiry sweep.
- `preview.ts` — rasterizes a preview to PNG with resvg (WebAssembly) and the
  bundled brand font subset.

## apps/web/src/editor/ — mutation and input

- `store.ts` — the single zustand store. Every change to the system goes
  through an action here; undo checkpoints, junction bookkeeping, station
  re-anchoring, and NamedWay upkeep all live in the actions.
- `keymap.ts` — the declarative keyboard table
  ([Keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md)).

## apps/web/src/map/ — MapLibre

- `layers.ts` — turns the system into GeoJSON sources and layers per view;
  owns paint order (street surfaces below footprints, labels on top).
- `interactions.ts` — the pointer state machine: drawing, dragging,
  snapping, route drafting, station-land drawing.
- `MapCanvas.tsx` — the map component; keeps sources in sync with the store
  and heals overlay layers if the style reloads.
- `vehicles.ts` — the ambient vehicle animation.
- `basemap.ts`, `icons.ts`, `mapRef.ts`, `selectionFocus.ts` — supporting
  pieces.

## apps/web/src/ui/ — components

`Workbench.tsx` is the shell that arranges everything; `Toolbar.tsx` is the
bottom dock; `Inspector.tsx` (with `NodeInspector.tsx`,
`CrossSectionEditor.tsx`, `InspectorTabs.tsx`) is the right-hand panel;
plus dialogs (export, import, share, schedule, systems) and primitives
(popover, modal, dropdown). Components hold no domain logic.

## Testing

`pnpm verify` runs `apps/web/scripts/verify.ts`: hundreds of deterministic
checks over the model, profile operations, migrations, junction geometry,
routing, store actions, and layer emission. No browser required.
`pnpm typecheck` covers `packages/core`, `apps/web`, and `apps/worker`. Both
must pass before a PR. Each command fans out per-package via Turborepo.
