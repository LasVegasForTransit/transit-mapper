# Road Editor: Lane-Level Cross-Sections, Geometric Intersections & Shared Identity

## Context

TransitMapper's unified `Way` model treats roads as first-class infrastructure, but a road today is
just a centerline with a scalar `capacity` fanned into identical parallel lines. The user wants a
SimCity/Cities: Skylines-grade road editor: drag roads with the existing tools, customize lanes
(count, width, kind, direction), get **real geometric intersections** automatically when roads
cross, edit turn lanes per junction, model medians and paired one-way carriageways that share one
identity ("Decatur Avenue"), and support pedestrian-only lanes/paths — all turnkey via GUI with
optional keyboard shortcuts.

Decisions made in brainstorming (all user-confirmed):

- **Full geometric intersections** (trimmed carriageways, junction polygons, corner fillets, lane
  connector curves) — not schematic-only.
- **Real lane-connectivity graph** (incoming lane → outgoing lane per junction) so future
  routing/simulation gets the graph for free.
- **Generalized to ALL way types** — cross-section profiles replace scalar capacity for
  rail/bike/etc. too (tracks are a lane kind). No road-only parallel system; catalog-driven, no
  hardcoded kinds (standing non-negotiable).
- **Roll our own pure-TS geometry engine**; osm2streets researched and rejected as a dependency
  (OSM-XML batch converter, fights interactive editing) but its left-to-right lane-list schema
  convention and A/B Street's published intersection algorithm are adopted as reference. Optional
  future: osm2streets-js to enrich OSM imports.
- Shared-identity entity is **`NamedWay`** (neutral internal name); the way-type family in the
  catalog supplies the user-facing noun ("Street" / "Line" / "Trail"). "Corridor" rejected as
  planning-jargon.

## Data model (src/model/)

All pure domain data; style stays in `src/style/catalogStyle.ts` per the enforced boundary.

**catalog.ts additions:**

- `LaneKindDef { id, label, role: "travel"|"separator"|"edge", defaultWidthM, widthPresetsM }`;
  `LANE_KINDS`: drive, bus, bike, parking, turnPocket, median, sidewalk, shoulder, track, platform,
  …
- Each `WayType` declares allowed lane kinds + default profile. Pedestrian-only path = a way type
  whose default profile is one sidewalk lane (no special casing).
- `ProfilePreset { id, label, wayTypeId, classId?, lanes }` — e.g. "2-lane local", "4-lane
  arterial", "Divided boulevard", "5-lane w/ center turn".
- Way-type family gains a display noun for identities ("Street"/"Line"/"Trail").

**system.ts:**

```ts
interface LaneSpec {
  id: string;
  kindId: string;
  widthM: number;
  direction: 'forward' | 'backward' | 'both' | 'none';
} // relative to point order
interface CrossSection {
  lanes: LaneSpec[];
} // left-to-right facing forward (osm2streets convention)
// Way: + profile: CrossSection; capacity becomes DERIVED (count of travel lanes)
interface LaneConnector {
  from: { wayId; laneId };
  to: { wayId; laneId };
}
// Node: + connectors?: LaneConnector[]  (auto-derived by heuristic; stored only once user customizes)
//       + control?: "uncontrolled"|"signal"|"stop"|"roundabout"
interface NamedWay {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  wayIds: string[];
}
```

- Profile is **constant per Way**; cross-section changes (turn pocket appears, lane drop) = split
  the way (`splitWayAt` exists); pieces keep identity via `NamedWay`.
- Widths stored meters, displayed feet (Vegas presets 10/11/12 ft).
- Turn arrows are derived from connectors, never stored separately.

**serialize.ts:** bump to v6; migrate capacity+classId → default profiles for every way type (rail
included). Round-trip tests on v3–v5 fixtures so saved systems and D1 snapshots load unchanged.

**store.ts new actions:** profile edits (set/add/remove/reorder/flip lane, apply preset),
`setNodeControl`, `setLaneConnectors`, `formCrossingJunctions`, `separateCarriageways(wayId)`,
`combineCarriageways(namedWayId)`, `mergeWays` (missing inverse of `splitWayAt`), NamedWay CRUD.
Keep helpers in sync: `cascadeMove`, node-ref shifting, `reanchorStations`, undo checkpoints.

## Geometry engine (new src/geometry/, pure & network-free)

Derives drawable geometry from the model on demand; never mutates it. Memoized via `WeakMap` on
immutable objects like `resolveWayPath`. Four staged pure functions + orchestrator
`deriveStreetGeometry(system, bbox)`:

1. `laneOffsets(way)` — signed per-lane offset polylines from cumulative widths; carriageway edge
   polylines. Local-meter math via existing `geo.ts` mercator helpers.
2. `junctionFootprint(node, ways)` — A/B Street algorithm: thicken incident ways, intersect adjacent
   edge lines for per-way **trim-back distances**, connect trim points with corner fillets. Explicit
   fallbacks for degenerate cases (2-way pass-through, acute angles, overlap). Densest unit tests in
   the repo (T, 4-way, 5-way, acute).
3. `connectorCurves(node)` — cubic Béziers between trimmed lane endpoints per lane connector (stored
   or heuristic default); rendered as junction lane guides; future routing edges.
4. `markings(way, node)` — dividers (dashed same-direction, double-solid between directions), turn
   arrows from connectors, crosswalks where sidewalk lanes meet junctions, median fills. Trim
   distances from stage 2 feed stage 1 (carriageways shorten at junctions).

**Performance (user-probed, approved):** zoom-gated LOD (lane geometry only ≥ ~z15–16; below,
today's cheap line rendering — whole-valley view never derives lanes); viewport-scoped derivation
over a new grid spatial index (shared with the snap engine, currently a linear scan);
per-way/per-node memoization (a drag invalidates 1 way + ≤2 nodes); split MapLibre sources — static
derived geometry rebuilt on commit/viewport change vs a small scratch source for the
actively-dragged way updated via existing `rafThrottle`. Escape hatch: module is pure → Web Worker
move is mechanical. Add a `verify.ts` perf budget check.

## Rendering (src/map/layers.ts + src/style/catalogStyle.ts)

- Promote `emitCrossSection` (currently a scalar-fan closure in `buildFeatures`, layers.ts:150–174)
  to consume derived per-lane geometry; junction polygons, lane fills, markings, connector guides as
  new sources/layers, **Infrastructure view only**; Network view unchanged.
- All colors/widths/dashes in `catalogStyle.ts` (style boundary; per-lane-kind styling).
- Street name labels along NamedWays at high zoom.
- Junction footprints hit-testable/selectable.

## Editing UX

- **Drawing unchanged & unified** — roads draw via the existing `startDraw` path; the draft panel
  gains catalog-driven profile preset chips. Turnkey = pick preset, drag.
- **Auto-intersection on crossing:** on way commit / endpoint drag-release, `formCrossingJunctions`
  splits both ways at same-grade crossings (`segmentsCross` in validate.ts finds them;
  `splitWayAt` + node linking) and derives default connectors. Grade-aware: elevated over surface =
  overpass, NO junction. One undo checkpoint.
- **Cross-section editor** in `WayInspector` (Inspector.tsx): horizontal lane-card strip mirroring
  the street left-to-right; per-card kind picker (allowed kinds from catalog), width preset chips
  (ft), direction toggle; add/remove/reorder/mirror/flip; one-way ⇄ two-way toggle. The strip
  doubles as the live cross-section preview.
- **Junction editor:** new `NodeInspector` on footprint selection — control type; per-approach lane
  list with toggleable turn arrows (←↑→) that edit real connectors; map redraws connector guides
  live.
- **Identity:** name field on `WayInspector` creates/joins a `NamedWay` (label from family noun);
  "Separate carriageways" (two-way profile → two one-way ways around a median, same NamedWay) /
  "Combine carriageways"; `mergeWays` for end-to-end joins.
- **Keyboard** (declarative keymap.ts additions, all optional-secondary): `[`/`]` lane count, `D`
  flip direction, `O` one-way, `1–9` presets while drawing.

## Phasing (each shippable + browser-verified)

- **R1 — Model & migration:** catalogs, CrossSection, NamedWay, Node connectors/control, v6
  migration, store actions, verify.ts coverage. No visual change beyond nothing breaking.
- **R2 — Lanes visible & editable:** geometry stage 1 + markings, LOD, spatial index, source split;
  lane-card editor; preset chips. Multi-lane roads drawable and fully customizable.
- **R3 — Real intersections:** junction footprints + trim-back, auto-intersection on crossing,
  connector curves, NodeInspector turn-lane editor. The Cities: Skylines payoff.
- **R4 — Identity & carriageways:** NamedWay + labels, separate/combine, mergeWays, keyboard
  shortcuts.
- (Future, out of scope: routing/simulation over the lane graph; osm2streets-js import enrichment.)

## Critical files

Modify: `src/model/catalog.ts`, `src/model/system.ts`, `src/model/serialize.ts`, `src/model/geo.ts`
(spatial index), `src/model/validate.ts` (crossing reuse), `src/editor/store.ts`,
`src/editor/keymap.ts`, `src/map/layers.ts`, `src/map/interactions.ts`, `src/ui/Inspector.tsx` (+
new `NodeInspector`), `src/style/catalogStyle.ts`. New: `src/geometry/` (offsets, junction,
connectors, markings, orchestrator + tests).

Reuse (do not reinvent): `splitWayAt`, `joinWayPointToWay`, `cascadeMove`, node-ref sync helpers,
`snap`/`nearestOpenEndpoint`, `resolveWayPath`/`roundedCorners`, `segmentsCross`, `rafThrottle`,
undo checkpoint wrappers, chip/stepper UI patterns in Inspector.

Standing constraints honored: no hardcoded kinds (all catalogs); style/domain separation; no inline
typedefs (named interfaces); zustand selector stability gotcha; monochrome chrome (lane/junction
rendering is infrastructure ink, not UI accent color); Escape cancels in-flight gestures (new drags
must register with `cancelActiveGesture`).

## Verification

- `verify.ts` unit suites per pure module: profile ops, migration round-trips (v3–v5 fixtures),
  junction trim-back matrix (2-way/T/4-way/5-way/acute), connector heuristics, perf budget (derive a
  few-hundred-way viewport under budget).
- Browser (per transitmapper-verification-notes: pump 1–2 screenshots first, resize before
  fitBounds): draw two crossing arterials → junction forms with footprint; edit lanes in the strip →
  map updates; toggle turn arrows → connector guides change; separate Decatur into carriageways →
  two one-way ways, one label; zoom out → LOD collapses to lines; undo/redo and Escape-cancel across
  all new gestures; existing saves load (v6 migration).
- On completion, invoke superpowers:writing-plans conventions already satisfied by this plan; commit
  only when asked (ASCII-cow rule applies).

## First implementation step

Commit this design as `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-road-editor-design.md` (per brainstorming
skill; deferred from plan mode), then begin R1.
